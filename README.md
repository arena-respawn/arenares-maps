Collection of Arena Respawn maps for TF2.

Arena Respawn Gamemode Design (This overview highlights the changes made to Arena mode):

- First Blood crits are disabled.
- Each round starts with 1 minute and 45 seconds timer. If neither team captures the point within that time, the round results in a stalemate.
- After 15 seconds from the round start, the capture point unlocks.
- The capture rate for the point is 2 seconds. Only one player affects the capture rate.
- When a player captures the point, their teammates respawn, and timer is set to 1 minute and 45 seconds.
- When a player is on a captured point that belong to their team, they'll be marked for death. The debuff expires within 5 seconds when leaving the captured point.
  
Why Add These Changes (These changes prioritizes toward causal players):
- First Blood crits was too punishing.
- As round starts with a 1 minute and 45 second timer, making players move quickly to fight.
- Changing the 15 seconds from the round start unlocking capture point to 45 seconds could incentivize deathmatch against other players outside of control point, but players do not like waiting to respawn.
- Fast capture rate means less risk, high reward to help teammates respawn.
- Letting players respawn on a captured point doesn't make them stare at the spectator screen.
- Marked for death debuff on a captured point that belong to to their team prevents sabotaging the enemy capper.

Report (Competitive players are not included in this report):
- According to an uncredible poll, the most favorited arena gamemode Valve map is arena_lumberyard.
- Average match should be around 20 minutes.
- Players in Arena mode rarely wait for the timer to expire.
- Players class changing and using varying type of loadout for fun.
- Stock Engineer is often punished for sitting at spawn.
