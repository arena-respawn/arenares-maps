Collection of Arena Respawn maps for TF2.

The gamemode design philosophy of Arena Respawn:
- First Blood crits are disaabled.
- Each round starts with a 5 minute timer. If neither team captures the capture point within that time, the round results in a stalemate.
- The capture point unlocks 15 seconds after the round begins.
- The capture time for the point is 2 seconds.
- When a player captures the point, their teammates respawn, and the timer is set to the default 1 minute and 30 seconds.
