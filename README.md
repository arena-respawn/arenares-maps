Collection of Arena Respawn maps for TF2.

Arena Respawn Gamemode Design (This overview highlights the changes made to Arena mode):

- First Blood crits are disabled.
- Each round starts with 1 minute and 45 seconds timer. If neither team captures the point within that time, the round results in a stalemate.
- After 15 seconds from the round start, the capture point unlocks.
- The capture rate for the point is 2 seconds. Only one player affects the capture rate.
- When a player captures the point, their teammates respawn, and timer is set to 1 minute and 45 seconds.
  
Notes:
- Changing the 15 seconds from the round start unlocking capture point to 45 seconds could incentivize deathmatch against other players, but players do not like waiting to respawn.
- According to an unknown poll, the most favorited Valve map is arena_lumberyard.
- Players in Arena mode rarely wait for the timer to expire.
- Average match should be around 20 minutes.
- The gamemode design is prioritizes toward causal players.
