Collection of Arena Respawn maps for TF2.

The gamemode design of Arena Respawn:
- First Blood crits are disabled.
- Each round starts with 1 minute and 45 seconds timer. If neither team captures the point within that time, the round results in a stalemate.
- After 15 seconds from the round start, the capture point unlocks.
- The capture rate for the point is 2 seconds. Only one player affects the capture rate.
- When a player captures the point, their teammates respawn, and timer is set to 1 minute and 45 seconds.

Note that changing the 15 seconds from the round start to 45 seconds could incentivize deathmatch against other players, but players do not like waiting to respawn.
