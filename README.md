Collection of Arena Respawn maps for TF2.

The gamemode design of Arena Respawn:
- First Blood crits are disabled.
- Each round starts with a 5 minute timer. If neither team captures the point within that time, the round results in a stalemate.
- After 15 seconds from the round start, the capture point unlocks.
- The capture rate for the point is 2 seconds. Only one player affects the capture rate.
- When a player captures the point, their teammates respawn, and the timer is set to 1 minute and 30 seconds.
